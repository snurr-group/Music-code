Zhao Li's note:
From music-4.0.tar.gz<br/>
Folder "music-3-1" contains the stuff from music-3-1.tar.gz on zeolite server

1) To do a complete test:
>> ./testall > testlog

This will make sure all executable are linked, and then perform
individual tests. After finishing inspect 'testlog'. Also look at
individual 'temp' file in each directory

2) To do an individual test
>> cd test001-md-H2O
>> run

Make sure that md.exe is linked to currect executable

KNOWN PROBLEMS:
1) currently test008 is broken
