------------------------------------------ 

In this simulation butane molecules in gas phase is considered.  This
is a very simple example for demonstrating music MD. The butane
molecules are modeled using the united atom model with methyl and
methylene groups. Molecules interact with each other through lennard
jones interactions. There are intramolecular potentials for bond
stretching, bond bending and bond torsion. The post code analysis is
used to get diffusivities energy averages etc.
