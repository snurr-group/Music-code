Contains two things : 

1) Program for calculating sigma for a single component from given
Isotherm. ( Can also process a list of isotherms of differenent
species)

2) Program for getting binary adsorption isotherm from sigma-p plot of
two compounds (obtained using previous program)

Note : 
	All src code in directory ./src
	driver for program.1 : ./drivers/music_sigma.F90
	driver for program.2 : ./drivers/music_binary.F90

Files in this directory :
sigma.exe 		: executable for program.1 (tol , mxyl )
sigma.ctr 		: ctrlfile  for use with sigma.exe 
isoT-mxyl.dat           : mxylene adsorption isotherm from a single comp 
			  gcmc run. The format should be preserved
isoT-tol.dat            : toluene adsorption isotherm from a single comp 
			  gcmc run. The format should be preserved
out-mxyl.dat            : output, contains p, n, sigma values
out-tol.dat             : output, contains p, n, sigma values

binary.exe 		: executable for program.2 (tol , mxyl )
binary.ctr 		: ctrlfile  for use with binary.exe 
binary.dat              : output, ias calculation results for the binay mixture
( binary.exe uses out-mxyl.dat and out-tol.dat )

npcheck.m, sigma.m      : some modifiable matlab scripts for plotting
